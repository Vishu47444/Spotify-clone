A simple Spotify clone built using HTML and CSS. This project aims to replicate the visual design and layout of the Spotify platform, allowing users to experience a music streaming interface without the backend functionality.

This project includes the following features:
A landing page with a hero section.
A music player interface.
Playlist and song cards.
Simple responsive design for mobile and desktop views.

Tech Stack
Frontend:
HTML
CSS (with Flexbox)

File Structure
The project follows this simple file structure:


spotify-clone/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file for the landing page and UI layout
├── style.css           # CSS file for styling the layout and components
└── assets/
    ├── images/         # Contains images like album covers, icons, etc.
    
index.html: Contains the structure of the landing page, music player, and playlist components.
style.css: Contains styles for the entire page, including layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness.
assets/images/: Stores images like album artwork, icons, and other media.


Features
Responsive Design: The page adapts to both desktop and mobile views.

Landing Page: The main page showcases a hero section with a Spotify-like background and branding.

Music Player: A basic music player interface with play/pause buttons, volume controls, and track progress bars (mock-up only, no functionality).

Playlist Section: Display different playlists with album artwork, titles, and "Play" buttons (styling only, no interaction).

Usage
Open the index.html file in your browser to see the layout.
The layout is designed to look similar to the Spotify interface, focusing on structure and style rather than backend functionality.
The page is styled to be responsive, so you can resize the browser window or open it on a mobile device to see how it adjusts.

Customization
You can customize the following aspects of the project:

Colors: Modify the color scheme in the style.css file to match your preferences.
Fonts: Update the font-family in the CSS to use a different font (e.g., Google Fonts).
Images: Replace the images in the assets/images/ folder with your own album covers and background images.
Layout: Modify the layout using CSS Flexbox or Grid to adjust how content is displayed.
